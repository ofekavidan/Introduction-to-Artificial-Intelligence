<h1 align="center">Exercise 2 - 2048</h1>

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course at HUJI (Hebrew University of Jerusalem). The main goal of this exercise is to implement AI agents and search strategies to solve the popular **2048 game**. The project applies search-based methods and multi-agent systems to optimize the game-playing strategies.

## Repository Structure

- **`2048.py`**: Main script to run the 2048 game.
- **`displays.py`**: Handles different display modes for the game (e.g., text-based or graphical).
- **`game.py`**: Defines the core game logic and management of the game state.
- **`game_grid.py`**: Implements the grid system for the 2048 board.
- **`game_state.py`**: Tracks the state of the game, such as the board, scores, and moves.
- **`game2048_grid.py`**: Contains specific logic for the 2048 game grid setup and manipulation.
- **`graphics_display.py`**: Manages the graphical display for a more visual representation of the game.
- **`keyboard_agent.py`**: Defines an agent that plays the game using keyboard inputs.
- **`multi_agents.py`**: Implements multi-agent systems to control the game's decision-making process.
- **`util.py`**: Utility functions and data structures used across the project.
