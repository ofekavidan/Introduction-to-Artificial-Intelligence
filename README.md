## Course Overview

This repository contains a series of projects developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course at **HUJI (Hebrew University of Jerusalem)**. The projects explore a variety of AI topics including search algorithms, multi-agent systems, and planning graphs. Each project is focused on implementing key AI techniques to solve classical AI problems.

Below is a brief overview of the exercises included in this repository.

</p>

This exercise focuses on solving classic puzzles like **Blokus** and **8-Puzzle** using **state-space search algorithms**. The implemented algorithms include:

- **Depth First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**
- **A* Search**

The framework supports running various games and puzzles, with options to experiment with different search techniques.

</p>

This exercise involves the implementation of AI agents for the popular **2048 game**. The project focuses on developing intelligent agents using:

- **Multi-agent systems**
- **Search-based strategies**
- **Keyboard-controlled agents**

The project includes both a text-based and graphical display of the game, allowing for both human and AI players to interact with the game.

</p>

In this exercise, the **Planning Graph Algorithm** is applied to solve complex planning problems such as the **Tower of Hanoi**. The exercise involves:

- Building a **graph-based representation** of a problem's actions and states.
- Solving planning problems using **action layers** and **proposition layers**.
- Search algorithms for traversing the Planning Graph to find solutions.
