<h1 align="center">Exercise 1 - Blokus</h1>

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course at [Huji]. The project implements various classic AI search algorithms and game-solving strategies. Specifically, the exercise explores solving puzzle problems like **Blokus** and **8-Puzzle**, using state-space search algorithms like **DFS (Depth First Search)**, **BFS (Breadth First Search)**, and more advanced heuristics.

## Repository Structure

- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the Python package for the project.
- **`blokus_problems.py`**: Contains the logic and problem definitions for the Blokus game.
- **`board.py`**: Implements the game board functionality used in Blokus and other games.
- **`displays.py`**: Manages the visual representation and debugging output for the various games.
- **`eightpuzzle.py`**: Implements the 8-puzzle problem, with functions for puzzle setup and manipulation.
- **`game.py`**: Provides the main game framework for handling different games like Blokus and Pacman.
- **`inputs.py`**: Handles user inputs for the games.
- **`pacman.py`**: Implements the Pacman game logic and interaction.
- **`pieces.py`**: Contains the definitions and logic for the game pieces (used primarily for Blokus).
- **`search.py`**: Implements search algorithms like DFS, BFS, A* search, and others, which are used to solve various problems.
